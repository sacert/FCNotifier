Send a message once your file has finished downloading, installing, or deleting 

##### NOTE: Current version is only Mac compatible 

Checks the file to see if any writes have been detected within an interval; if no writes have been detected after the file has initially begun modification, then the file is done. **Make sure your download has started before running the program.***

##### Things to modify:

Within the `SendEmail.java` class, modifications need to be made for `String username` and `String password` which need to be a valid gmail account. I would recommend setting up a email bot using gmail.

##### Sending a message:

Firstly you must enter the email address of the recipient and then add a custom message to what you wish to send them. 

**Note:** Many cell phone providers allow the access of sending SMS messages via email. An extensive list may be found [here]
